# Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning

This program implements the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for a 2-player game. It includes:
- A game model with rules and state evaluation.
- Implementation of the Minimax algorithm to find optimal moves.
- Alpha-Beta pruning for efficiency.

## How It Works
1. Players take turns making moves (`X` and `O`).
2. The algorithm evaluates the game state and chooses the best move for the player.
3. The game ends when there is a win or draw.

### Usage
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python Q1.py
