This script solves the N-Queens problem using a hill-climbing approach. The goal is to place `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

## How It Works
1. Generates a random initial board configuration.
2. Iteratively improves the configuration by reducing conflicts.
3. Stops when a solution is found or the algorithm gets stuck in a local optimum.

### Usage
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python Q2.py
