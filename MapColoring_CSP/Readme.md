This script solves the Map Coloring problem using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques. It assigns colors to regions of a map such that no two adjacent regions have the same color.

## How It Works
1. Represents regions as variables with color domains.
2. Uses backtracking to assign colors.
3. Prunes the search space to improve efficiency.

### Usage
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python Q3.py
