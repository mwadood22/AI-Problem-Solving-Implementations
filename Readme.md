# AI Problem-Solving Implementations

This repository showcases various implementations of Artificial Intelligence algorithms and techniques, developed as part of coursework during my undergraduate studies. Each implementation demonstrates a different approach to solving AI-related problems.

## Contents

### 1. Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **Directory**: `Q1_Minimax_AlphaBeta`
- **Description**: Implements the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for a 2-player turn-based game. The program uses a simple game model to demonstrate decision-making based on state evaluation.
- **Highlights**: State evaluation, pruning, and optimization in decision trees.

### 2. N-Queens Problem using Hill Climbing
- **Directory**: `Q2_NQueens_HillClimbing`
- **Description**: Solves the N-Queens problem using a hill-climbing approach. The solution focuses on optimizing the arrangement of queens on a chessboard to minimize conflicts.
- **Highlights**: Local search, optimization, and heuristics.

### 3. Map Coloring Problem using CSP
- **Directory**: `Q3_MapColoring_CSP`
- **Description**: Solves the Map Coloring problem using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques. It assigns colors to regions such that no two adjacent regions share the same color.
- **Highlights**: CSP formulation, backtracking, and domain pruning.
